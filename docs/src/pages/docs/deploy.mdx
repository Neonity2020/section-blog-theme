To deploy a section blog theme on Vercel, Netlify, etc., you don't need a special requirement. You can deploy a section blog theme like the usual application.

But when you deploy the section blog theme on the GitHub page, you need GitHub action according to the node package manager. 

## To Deploy on Github Pages

To deploy the section blog theme on **GitHub pages** follow the below step. 

<Steps>

### Add output, basepath and unoptimized in nextjs config file.

```javascript {9-13} filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

const withNextra = require("nextra")({
  theme: "section-blog-theme",
  themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});
 
module.exports = withNextra({
  output: 'export',
  basePath: "/your-repostory-name",
  images:{
    unoptimized: true
  }
}); 
```

### PNPM 
If you use PNPM, then use the following code for GitHub action to deploy the nextjs app on the GitHub page.

```yml filename=".github/workflows/deploy-nextjs-app-with-pnpm.yml"
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        name: Install pnpm
        id: pnpm-install
        with:
          version: 8
          run_install: true

      - name: Get pnpm store directory
        id: pnpm-cache
        shell: bash
        run: |
          echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        name: Setup pnpm cache
        with:
          path: ${{ steps.pnpm-cache.outputs.STORE_PATH }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
        with:
          static_site_generator: next
      - name: Static HTML export with Next.js
        run: pnpm next build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
        with:
          path: ./out

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2

```

### Yarn or NPM
If you use YARN OR NPM, then use the following code for GitHub action to deploy the nextjs app on the GitHub page.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/deploy-nextjs-app-with-yarn-or-npm.yml"
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Next.js site to GitHub Pages
#
# To get started with Next.js see: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started
#
name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Detect package manager
        id: detect-package-manager
        run: |
          if [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/yarn.lock" ]; then
            echo "manager=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "command=install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "runner=yarn" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          elif [ -f "${{ github.workspace }}/package.json" ]; then
            echo "manager=npm" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "command=ci" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "runner=npx --no-install" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            exit 0
          else
            echo "Unable to determine package manager."
            exit 1
          fi
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.manager }}
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
        with:
          # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable
          # server side image optimization (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized).
          #
          # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
          static_site_generator: next
      - name: Restore cache
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            .next/cache
          # Generate a new cache whenever packages or source files change.
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json', '**/yarn.lock') }}-${{ hashFiles('**.[jt]s', '**.[jt]sx') }}
          # If source files changed but packages didn't, rebuild from a prior cache.
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json', '**/yarn.lock') }}-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.manager }} ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.command }}
      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

```
Now push your local code into the GitHub repository and [enable GitHub pages permission](https://medium.com/frontendweb/how-to-deploy-the-next-js-app-router-application-on-github-pages-using-pnpm-54ac72424d80).
